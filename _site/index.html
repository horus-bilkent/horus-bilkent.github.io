    <p><a href="http://horus-bilkent.github.io/">Horus</a> is a <strong>Senior Design Project(CS 491)</strong> which aims to be an interim technology connecting current sensor tracking infrastructure to the cloud services using a simple camera and raspberry pie.</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>The development and adoption of Internet of Things is a critical element of data driven decision making. However, most of the technology to capture and track sensor measurements are developed and installed aren’t connected to the internet and can only be seen by measurement panels. Real-time tracking of the data generated by legacy systems is impossible without changing whole system. In this project, we propose an interim technology to track legacy control panels without adding big overhead by using a simple camera and image processing techniques that will bring power of the cloud and big data analytics to help our customers with the analysis of the data they accumulated from their sensor screens.</p>
